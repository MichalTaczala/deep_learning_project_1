# VENV ACTIVATION
Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment: python -m venv <env_name> Note: On some systems, you might need to use python3 instead of python

Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment
For Windows: <env_name>\Scripts\activate
For macOS and Linux: source <env_name>/bin/activate
Your command prompt or terminal should now show the virtual environment name.
